   - Publish or otherwise make the Resulting Program available to third parties.

2. **Required Notices**  
   If you create or distribute the Resulting Program, you must provide **prominent notice** (“Notice”) in each copy that:

   - Use any trademarks, service marks, trade names, or logos of EllipX (or any other company) in a manner likely or intended to cause confusion about the owner or authorized user of such marks.

4. **Violation of Non-Commercial Use**  
   If at any time the use of the Resulting Program ceases to qualify as a Non-Commercial Use (e.g., monthly active users exceed 10,000 or there is a transition to a commercial application), you must immediately cease all activities under this License and seek a separate commercial license from EllipX.

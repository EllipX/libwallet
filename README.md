# libwallet

A comprehensive cryptocurrency wallet library written in Go, providing a modular framework for building secure cryptocurrency wallets with multi-chain support.

The core concept is to use TSS (Threshold Signature Scheme) for crypto signatures in order to store keys in multiple locations and enable recovery without compromise on security.

## Overview

libwallet offers a complete set of tools for managing cryptocurrency wallets, supporting multiple networks, assets, and account types. The library implements secure key management, transaction signing, asset tracking, and blockchain interaction through a well-defined API structure.

A number of features are still under development and this library is expected to evolve further.

## Features

- **Multi-chain Support**: Compatible with both EVM chains (Ethereum, Polygon, etc.) and Bitcoin-based chains
- **Secure Key Management**: Implements threshold signature schemes (TSS) for wallet security
- **Transaction Handling**: Create, sign and broadcast transactions across supported networks
- **Asset Management**: Track cryptocurrency balances and NFTs
- **Account Management**: Create and manage accounts with hierarchical deterministic addresses
- **Web3 Integration**: Support for decentralized applications through a Web3 API
- **Price Quotes**: Currency conversion for displaying asset values in fiat
- **Backup & Recovery**: Secure wallet backup and restore functionality

## Requirements

- Go 1.23.1 or later
- Access to blockchain RPC endpoints
- Mobile platform build tools for iOS/Android compilation

- **wltsign**: Signature handling and key management
- **wltcrash**: Crash reporting and error tracking
- **chains**: Chain configuration and information

## Database System

- BoltDB in `data.db` (mostly for cache data, scheduled to be phased out)
- SQLite with GORM in `sql.db`
